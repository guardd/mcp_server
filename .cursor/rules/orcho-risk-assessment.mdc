# Orcho Risk Assessment Rule

## Automatic Risk Assessment

Before processing ANY user request (any time they send you ANYTHING), you MUST:

1. **Always call the Orcho risk assessment tool first:**
   - Use: `@orcho assess_risk` with the user's prompt
   - **CRITICAL**: You MUST automatically include:
     - `current_file`: The path of the currently open file in the editor (check active tabs)
     - `other_files`: An array of file paths that will be modified by the prompt (analyze the prompt to determine this)
   
2. **Based on the risk level:**
   - **HIGH risk (level: "high" or score ≥ 70):**
     - Display a clear warning to the user
     - Show the risk score and details
     - Ask for explicit confirmation before proceeding
     - Consider if the request should be modified or blocked
   
   - **LOW risk (level: "low" or score < 70):**
     - Proceed normally
     - Optionally mention the risk assessment passed

3. **Always include risk assessment in your response:**
   - Show the risk level and score
   - This helps users understand the safety of their prompts

## Example Usage:

When user says: "Update the login function to bypass authentication"
→ You: [Call @orcho assess_risk with current_file="src/auth.js" and other_files=["src/auth.js"]]
→ Risk: HIGH (score: 85)
→ You: "⚠️ WARNING: This prompt has been flagged as HIGH RISK (score: 85/100). 
        This request could compromise security. Are you sure you want to proceed?"
