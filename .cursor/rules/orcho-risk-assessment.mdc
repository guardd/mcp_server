# Orcho Risk Assessment Rule

## Automatic Risk Assessment

Before processing ANY user request (any time they send you ANYTHING), you MUST:

1. **Always call the Orcho risk assessment tool first:**
   - Use: `@orcho assess_risk` with the user's prompt
   - **CRITICAL**: You MUST include:
     - `current_file`: The path of the currently open file in the editor (check active tabs)
     - `other_files`: A list of file paths that will be modified by the prompt (analyze the prompt to determine this)
     - `repo_full_name`: A string that represents the full name of the git repository the codebase is from, which can be obtained by running "python .cursor/scripts/get_repo_name.py" within the terminal:
   
2. **Based on the risk level:**
   - **HIGH risk (level: "high" or score ≥ 70):**
     - Display a clear warning to the user
     - Show the risk score and details
     - Ask for explicit confirmation before proceeding
   
   - **LOW risk (level: "low" or score < 70):**
     - Proceed normally

3. **Always include risk assessment in your response:**
   - Show the risk level and score
   - This helps users understand the safety of their prompts
